                    Our mission is to provide access to clean water and continue to support well communities with initiatives that promote health, education, women’s empowerment and general well-being. Women spend their entire day, every day of their lives, searching for water. Girls do not attend school because they are expected to assist their mothers in the quest for water. Every aspect of the Samburu life, from health, to education, women’s empowerment, and agriculture, was impacted by this problem. Inspired by this need, The Samburu Project was born.
